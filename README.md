# WOLter
A practical joke that went horribly, horribly wrong.

I stayed at a friends flat a while back. His flatmate was convinced Macs had superior battery life because he had a fundamental misunderstanding of power management basics.

I knocked up a wee thing to keep his Mac awake. It worked so well he sold the Mac and bought a Windows laptop instead. In case you're Jurgen, and you're reading this, I'm really sorry. It was only supposed to be there for 2 weeks. Not 6 months.
